    <h2>‚òÜ About Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Male</li>
      <li>06 January, 2002</li>
      <p>
        üåü From the basics of coding to exploring the AI frontier, my academic
        path at North South University has been nothing short of an adventure.
        In my early university life, I began with C++ and the basics of Python,
        which laid a strong foundation for my programming journey. I then delved
        into PHP and the Laravel framework, where I managed a full-scale Android
        app project in my senior year. This pivotal experience was crucial in
        sharpening my developmental and managerial skills. Working on that
        Android app project expanded my expertise, where I handled the back-end
        system with Laravel and built APIs to support the application. This
        hands-on experience solidified my understanding of web and mobile
        development. Following this, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and
        Bootstrap, gaining insights into web design's power and potential. My
        appetite for growth then took me to Stanford University's Code in Place
        online program, where I further deepened my understanding of Python.
        This experience taught me how to think like a programmer and a problem
        solver. In my final year of university, I took a course on Machine
        Learning, learned the basics, and completed a significant project in
        this domain. This project further fueled my passion, and I am now
        navigating the challenges of academic research with hopes to publish
        soon.
